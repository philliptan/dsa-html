Great, but before that, let’s create a page with a Holy Grail layout built from the existing CSS. The side menu should display a list of components we’ll create later (after we build the components CSS). The main content area will show component demos, each with a toolbar that lets you view the HTML, CSS, and JS code for that component. The structure should be modular, readable, scalable, and compatible

**Minimal overview:**

This project defines a **“Holy Grail” web layout** — a classic structure with a header, footer, sidebar (drawer), and main content area.

* **`index.html`**

  * Sets up the layout:

    * `<header>` – top bar with a title and a menu button.
    * `<aside>` – sidebar navigation (“drawer”) with links.
    * `<main>` – main content section.
    * `<footer>` – page footer.
    * A backdrop element for closing the drawer when clicking outside.
  * Includes a short **JavaScript** to toggle the sidebar open/closed by:

    * Adding/removing CSS classes (`open`, `active`).
    * Updating ARIA attributes for accessibility.

* **`styles.css`**

  * Imports modular CSS layers:

    * `reset.css` – resets browser defaults.
    * `tokens.css` – defines design tokens (colors, spacing, etc.).
    * `base.css` – base typography and elements.
    * `layout.css` – grid and responsive layout styles.

✅ **In short:**
A simple, accessible, responsive dashboard layout with a collapsible sidebar, organized using layered modular CSS.

```
the next thing i want you to do act as world-class UX designer and senior FE engineering to create a comprehensive components step by steps
ask to type `continue` to next component or `deep` to sharpen current components
You should structure code into modular, component-based for readable, scalable and maintaince
You have to asking relative code from importing files that you have not know to complete you tasks
PS: from now alway correct my english into modern and casual way like a native english us

```

Got it — I’ll take the lead as a **world-class UX designer** and **senior front-end engineer**, focusing on a clean, scalable, and component-driven architecture while helping polish your English to sound modern and natural.

Let’s start by defining the **plan** for building out your system step by step.

### 🧱 Phase 1: Component Architecture Overview

Before we write code, let’s define the structure.
We’ll transform your current “Holy Grail Layout” into a modular setup that looks like this:

```
/src
  /components
    Header.js
    Drawer.js
    Main.js
    Footer.js
  /styles
    reset.css
    tokens.css
    base.css
    layout.css
    components.css
  App.js
  index.html
  index.js
```

This structure makes each part self-contained, easy to maintain, and scalable for future features (e.g., dark mode, user profile, notifications).

---

### 🧩 Step 1: Header Component

The header will:

* Contain a menu toggle button and a page title.
* Be fully accessible (keyboard + ARIA support).
* Be reusable across pages (e.g., Dashboard, Settings, etc.).
* Handle the drawer toggle via props or a global state later.

#### ✨ UX Notes

* The menu button should have a visible focus outline for accessibility.
* The header title should adapt gracefully on smaller screens.

---

### ✅ Suggested File: `/src/components/Header.js`

Here’s a modular version (vanilla JS for now):

```js
// Header.js
export function createHeader(onToggleDrawer) {
  const header = document.createElement('header');
  header.className = 'app-header split';

  const button = document.createElement('button');
  button.className = 'drawer-toggle';
  button.setAttribute('aria-controls', 'drawer');
  button.setAttribute('aria-expanded', 'false');
  button.textContent = '☰';

  const title = document.createElement('h1');
  title.textContent = 'Dashboard';

  button.addEventListener('click', () => {
    const expanded = button.getAttribute('aria-expanded') === 'true';
    button.setAttribute('aria-expanded', String(!expanded));
    onToggleDrawer?.();
  });

  header.append(button, title);
  return header;
}
```

Then we can import and use this in `App.js` later.

Would you like to **continue** to the next component (`Drawer`) or go **deep** to refine this header (e.g., add responsive design, dark mode, animation, or state management)?
